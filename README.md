### What to use? 

*Use whatever you want but main goal is to achieve a working vinyl player.*

### Hosting a website 
**Note that hosting is an essential task in this project.**

- Firebase
*is google powered* 
- Great all-arounder and got a good free plan for our needs.

**Considering this project as a studying and non-commercial usage, that is why it is not worth buying any other plan.**

#### Also firebase got a decent redable domain name. 
- No need to buy a specific domain name 
*If needed the:
